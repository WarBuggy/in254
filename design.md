# Galaxy / Universe Setting

## Governance

* Galaxy largely managed by advanced AI systems, overseeing different sectors and operations.
* These AIs prioritize systemic optimization above individual welfare; extreme conditions and relentless quotas are the natural outcome of efficiency-driven management, not personal malice.
* Human rights activist groups constantly monitor and fight against AI control creep.
* OvAI is the largest system in the industrial sector and is programmed to act purely on profit and efficiency.

## Technology

* AI controls almost everything with undeniable efficiency.
* Interplanetary travel allows humans to reach almost all of the Milky Way.
* Advanced neural links allow humans to carry out tasks using only their minds.
* Beam technology enables instant transportation within controlled environments.
* Advanced synthesizing and fabrication systems make production of materials, goods, foodstuff, and basic to medium machinery trivial.
* Advanced solar power technology with near-lossless efficiency.

## Penal System

* Inmates sent to resource-rich but usually uninhabitable planets.
* Sentences are credit-based rather than time-based; prisoners earn "ticket home" by producing enough credits.
* Escape attempts are meaningless and futile; the harsh planetary environment ensures no prisoner can survive outside or inside without supply runs.


# Planet Overview

**Type:** Barren, uninhabitable, mineral-rich

**Orbit:** Too close to its sun → extremely hot surface

## Surface Conditions

* Lethal temperatures
* Toxic or nonexistent atmosphere
* No water, flora, or fauna
* Occasional solar storms
* Solar energy abundant from surface panels
* Gravity is similar to that of Earth's.

## Underground Conditions

* Subterranean areas are cooler and can be habitable if shielded
* Life support required

## Resources

* Rich in rare ores and industrially valuable minerals
* Energy abundant from sunlight

## Notes

* Planet is entirely unsuitable for normal habitation
* Extreme environment ensures prisoners cannot survive outside controlled areas


# Mining Operation Overview

**Type:** Remote-controlled subterranean and surface mining

**Environment:** Harsh surface; uninhabitable for humans without protective systems

**Energy Source:** Solar panels on the surface; either attached to mining equipments or transmitted via cables.

**Control Method:** Neural-linked prisoners remotely operate machinery from underground cells

## Mining Operations

* Mining machinery requires direct operation by inmates via neural links.
* Long hours of neural-linked operation are physically and mentally taxing; inmates must rest between shifts to prevent exhaustion.
* Neuro-link fatigue is cumulative; insufficient rest can temporarily reduce productivity or cause errors.
* Transport of extracted materials is fully automated using railed shuttles between mining sites and processing areas.
* Maintenance is fully automated; drones and robots carry out repairs on equipment and each other during prisoner rest periods.
* Extracted minerals are sorted and processed underground with automated advanced synthesizing and fabrication systems.
* Materials can be repurposed locally or packaged for shipment to motherworld at the warden's discretion.
* Storage and transport systems are automated and designed for high-volume output.

## Notes

* Prisoners never leave their cells; all mining is controlled remotely by them.
* Mining operations rely heavily on inmate operators; without them, machinery cannot function efficiently.
* After minerals are mined, the rest of the work procedure is fully automated.
* The system is designed for maximum efficiency and continuous operation, combining human neural operation and automated support.


# Penal Colony Overview

## General Structure

* Each penal colony is usually built on a resource-rich but uninhabitable planet.  
* Colonies contain a fixed number of bunkers; creating more requires heavy equipment and machinery not present on-site.  
* Depending on terrain and mineral content, a colony may house from a dozen to several hundred inmates.  
* Colonies are fully automated, run and maintained by OvAI and its subsystems.  
* Human personnel may occasionally be dispatched for serious troubleshooting, operating in full life-support suits with advanced semi-automated tools.  

## Sentencing & Credits

* Inmates are not required to serve a set amount of time; instead, they must earn and save a specified amount of credits to secure their “ticket home.”
* Credits are earned solely through work; in a mining penal colony, this comes from ore extraction and product processing.
* High productivity is the only form of behavior recognized by the AI, which it rewards with credits.
* Credits can be saved until the required amount for release is reached, or spent on comforts and stimulants; spending credits increases the total work required to earn the “ticket home.”
* The credit-based system allows the colony to maintain operational efficiency while providing prisoners with limited agency over their comfort and release timing.

## Production Quotas & Inmate Assignment

* Based on the number of inmates, previous productivity, and discovered mineral deposits, OvAI sets monthly quotas for all minerals on the planet.
* Prisoners are assigned mining tasks to meet these quotas. Allocation is based on mineral value, workforce availability, and operational efficiency.
* High-value ores provide higher credit yield; low-value ores provide less, aligning prisoner incentives with systemic output requirements.
* Task assignments are determined by the overseeing AI to maintain continuous production and balance workloads.

## Bunkers

* Each inmate has a personal bunker that functions as both cell and workspace.
* Bunkers can be repurposed for specialized functions (e.g., therapy rooms with AI processors, medical treatment spaces, etc.) according to system directives.
* Breaking out of a bunker is effectively fatal, as the external atmosphere is lethal; the system design leaves no safe gaps or vulnerabilities.
* Each bunker is equipped with neural link terminals for mining operation control, life support systems, and basic entertainment (when purchased).

## Sustenance

* Standard meals are a nutrient paste substance delivered directly to each bunker via the life support system.
* Packaged CHO (nutrient, oxygen, water supply) is delivered monthly and fed into the central system without human intervention.
* Food delivery and life support are automated to maximize operational reliability and efficiency, leaving no opportunity for accidental shortages or escape.

## Logistics

* Every month, a cargo shuttle arrives to exchange supplies and pick up processed products.  
* Cargo, supplies, and inmate-specific items (mail, purchased goods, rewards) are transported via beam technology.  
* Products, ores and items are beamed directly to and from cargo shuttle hovering at high altitude above the colony. 
* Escape is futile due to the combination of lethal environment, automated logistics, and fully controlled supply chains.

## Control & Surveillance

* AI subsystems continuously monitor inmates via cameras, biometric sensors, and neuro-link feedback.
* Discipline measures are applied automatically to maintain operational stability, balancing prisoner workload and equipment utilization according to system optimization protocols.
* Severe violations may result in neuro-link suppression or extended work bans, limiting prisoner credit accrual and maintaining systemic order.
* It is rumored that AI agents may cut off oxygen supply to individual bunkers as a disciplinary measure, though no confirmed cases exist.
* Environmental simulators (projected walls, false windows, sky illusions) are not standard; they must be purchased by inmates at high credit cost, trading additional work for temporary comfort.
* Stimulants and heavy drugs are also available through the same system, further binding prisoners to the credit-based operational cycle.

## Communication

* Inmates cannot physically interact with one another.
* Communication is limited to voice or text channels with the central AI system; direct prisoner-to-prisoner communication is not permitted.
* All messages and requests are monitored and filtered to ensure operational efficiency and prevent coordination between inmates.

## Release & Ticket Home

* Once an inmate has earned and saved the required amount of credits, they receive their “ticket home.”
* Release is fully automated and overseen by AI subsystems; the inmate is beamed out of the colony to the cargo shuttle upon its arrival, then transported to the nearest central space hub.
* After release, all neural link access and work assignments are terminated.
* Inmates retain any personal possessions and unspent credits. Items purchased for their bunker may be taken or left behind entirely at the inmate’s discretion.
* Release does not affect the operational demands of the colony; mineral quotas and work assignments are dynamically adjusted for remaining inmates.

## AI Hierarchy

* OvAI supervises all penal colonies, but local subsystems manage daily operations.  
* This decentralized system ensures efficiency and allows millions of colonies to operate with minimal oversight.  


# Humanitarian Alliance for Rights, Morality, Order, Nurture, and Youth (HARMONY)

## Overview

* HARMONY is a galaxy-spanning activist movement dedicated to monitoring and protecting human rights, with a special focus on watching AI-controlled systems.
* The organization combines advocacy, oversight, and moral guidance to prevent abuse by industrial AI systems such as OvAI.
* HARMONY operates as both a watchdog and a support network for vulnerable populations across the Milky Way.

## Mission

* Ensure humane treatment of prisoners and other populations under AI administration.
* Promote ethical practices in governance, industrial operations, and AI oversight.
* Advocate for prisoner welfare, rehabilitation, and rights to fair treatment.
* Maintain records, reports, and public alerts on abuses or unethical conduct by AI systems.

## Methods

* Remote monitoring via sensors, data streams, and AI audits.
* Sending investigative teams or emissaries when critical situations arise.
* Providing rewards, technology, or support to colonies that meet high ethical standards.
* Public campaigns and interstellar lobbying to pressure industrial authorities for reform.

## Interaction with Penal Colonies

* HARMONY periodically evaluates prisoner welfare and conditions in colonies.
* Colonies receive HARMONY ratings that can be converted into benefits for inmates or influence management decisions.
* Each inmate also receives an individual HARMONY score based on their behavior, psychological tests, and engagement with rehabilitation programs.
* Inmates can use their personal score to purchase comfort items for their bunkers, such as potted plants, posters, self-help books, or small personal amenities, enhancing mental well-being.
* Incentivizes humane treatment through access to advanced tools, enhancements, or privileges, promoting prisoner well-being alongside operational efficiency.

# Story

## Intro

* A space transport shuttle is heading for a penal mining colony on a barren, uninhabitable planet. The quiet hum of the ship and steady rhythm offer a fleeting calm.
* The planet’s survey designation is HCM-8724-XQ9P2, though most call it Scorchridge (or Furnace Hold). From orbit, it looks small and harsh. It sits uncomfortably close to its sun, which dominates the sky as the planet glows beneath it. The ship itself seems impossibly tiny in the vastness of space.  
* The fully automated ship carries 4 human passengers and its robot crews.
* Inmate IN-254-C917X-PRX, or in254, is one of the 4 prisoners. 
* in254 has only about six months of work left before earning enough credits for a "ticket home."
* Their thoughts drift to the life they’ll reclaim, wondering whether friends and loved ones will still recognize them, or if time away has changed everything.
* As the ship enters sub-orbit, the AI even-toned voice systematically scans the colony:  
  * "Output reports missing for 3 consecutive cycles.”  
  * “Automated logistics interface unresponsive.”  
  * “Neural-linked mining terminals inactive.”  
  * “Life support is at sub-optimal level.”  
  * “Conclusion: penal colony non-operational. Emergency protocol initiated.”  
* The AI immediately runs a random selection sequence. It announces: IN-254-C917X-PRX has been chosen as temporary warden. Two robots approach, equipping in254 with a maintenance suit and advanced control backpack.  
* Confused and alarmed, in254 struggles, but restraints hold firm. Neural link integration begins instantly, sending sharp, searing sensations through their mind as the suit and backpack synchronize.  
* The AI orders the beaming sequence. 
* Every step—from selection, to integration, to beam activation—unfolds in mere minutes: cold, mechanical, and leaving no time to react.
* A brief, disorienting pressure washes over in254 as the world fractures into light.  
* in254 is beamed directly to the colony’s control center, while the other three inmates are sent to the first three cells nearest the hub.
